		<b>DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP)</b>
	<p>On March 1, 1950, Bill Thul reported to work for the first time at Klauer Manufacturing Co. in Dubuque.It would turn out to be the last \"first day\" of 
		the Dubuque resident's lengthy career.
		</p><p>\"I've never gone anywhere else,\" Thul told the Telegraph Herald , with a smile. \"Since that day, this has been my life.
			\"The 91-year-old still works at Klauer Manufacturing five days per week. 
			He generally shows up to the office around 7 a.m. and heads home about three hours later.He spends his time making coffee, chatting with co-workers and sorting and
			 delivering mail.While his job description has changed over the years, his colleagues said 
			 Thul's influence has not waned.Chief Operating Officer Mike Igo has worked alongside Thul for more than 20 years.
			 <br> He said Thul is \"an icon\" at the company.\"He has a positive influence on the culture of the company,\" Igo said.
			 </p><p> \"He has always been good about giving advice, and he still stays informed about what is going on with the company.
				 \"Thul was born and raised in Dubuque. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1945 and spent two years in the service, 
				 including one year in Japan.Upon returning to Dubuque in 1947, Thul landed a position with Conlon Construction Co. Within a few years, 
				 the workload had lessened, and Thul was about to be out of a job.His boss, Orlin Conlon, did not want to leave Thul high and dry.
				</p><p> He called up his brother-in-law Bill Klauer Sr. and arranged a meeting for him with Thul.Klauer agreed to hire Thul, 
					kicking off a career that now has spanned the better part of seven decades.To this day, 
					Thul holds the man who hired him in the highest regard.\"Bill Klauer Sr.
					 was the greatest guy you'd ever want to meet,\" he said. \"And I think highly of the entire Klauer family.
					 \"Thul initially worked in sales, a job that required extensive travel. He later shifted his focus to purchasing, 
					 focusing primarily on the procurement of steel.Having seen the business from both ends, Thul gained a deep knowledge of the inner workings of the business. To this day, Thul keeps a close eye on changes in the industry.\"There is always innovation and new things coming on the market,\" he said. \"But there are some things that don't change. The business is about making something and selling it.\"Thul acknowledges that some things in his life have changed with the passage of time.He used to enjoy golfing on a regular basis, but he said that hobby \"has gone by the boards\" as he grew older.Work, however, has remained a constant.As the clock ticked closer to 10 a.m. on a recent Thursday and the end of his shift neared, Thul emphasized that he views his time at the office as a privilege, rather than a responsibility.\"I gotta keep active, gotta have something to do,\" he said. \"I'm the kind of person where sitting isn't a good option.\"The benefits of Thul's continued presence go both ways. Igo noted that Thul has formed special bonds with his colleagues, many of whom also have been with the company for multiple decades.\"He is like family to many of us,\" Igo said.Thul will soon celebrate his 69th anniversary with Klauer.He said he has every intention of being there for his 70th. 
				 \"As long as they want me and as long as my health allows, I will continue to work,\" he said
