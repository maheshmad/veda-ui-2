	<div class="entry-content">
			
	<p><strong>TUSCALOOSA, AL&nbsp;</strong>– The U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Turner Specialty Services LLC and Hunt Refining Co. for safety violations after an employee suffered a fatal injury at a refining facility in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The two companies collectively face $106,080 in penalties.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>The employee asphyxiated when he lost air supply while working in a confined space. OSHA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/citations/TurnerSpecialtyServicesLLC_1389105_0924_19.pdf">cited</a>&nbsp;Turner Specialty Services LLC – an industrial contractor – for failing to ensure personnel outside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/confinedspaces/">permit-required confined space</a>&nbsp;were capable of providing effective rescue. OSHA also cited the contractor for allowing an employee to enter the permit-required confined space with insufficient lighting equipment, and for assigning members of the rescue team other duties that prevented them from responding to an emergency event.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>OSHA cited Turner Specialty Services LLC and Hunt Refining Co. – a petroleum refiner –for failing to ensure that the confined space entry permits identified all hazards of the space, and document that all the steps required to ensure the employee&#8217;s safety in a confined space were completed. OSHA also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/citations/HuntRefiningCompany_1389177_0924_19.pdf">cited</a>&nbsp;Hunt Refining Co. for failing to ensure, through periodic evaluations, that Turner Specialty Services fulfilled their obligations as specified in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/dsg/psm/index.html">Process Safety Management</a>&nbsp;standard.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>&#8220;Employers should never allow workers to enter a space without properly evaluating the hazards and following required safety standards associated with entry,&#8221; said OSHA Area Director Ramona Morris, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>The companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&#8217;s area director, or contest the findings before the independent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oshrc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</a>.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA&#8217;s role is to help ensure these conditions for America&#8217;s working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education, and assistance.
