EMCO will continue to market the EMCO brand of steel siding and matching metal soffit, fascia and rain carrying products throughout North America while Klauer will introduce a new line of siding products to its customers.

EMCO will continue to be the leader in the steel siding arena by providing  our industry with superior steel products for the marketplace and by placing a greater focus on servicing  the needs of today's customer."  Bullinger goes on to say that, "Currently our steel siding products offer the best value in performance, fade protection, color selection, maintenance ease, and sustainabilityâ€¦not to mention it is backed by the strongest manufacturer warranty in the industry." Additionally, this alliance will help expand EMCO's sister company Eastside Machine in their distribution of seamless portable roll-forming machines (siding, gutter &amp; roofing) throughout the United States.</p>
